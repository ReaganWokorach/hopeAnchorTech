## You must do these manually (one-time, free)

### 1. Google Search Console — MOST IMPORTANT
> Gets you into Google's index and shows you exactly who's finding you

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click "Add property" → enter: `https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app`
3. Choose "HTML tag" verification method
4. Copy the verification meta tag they give you (looks like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXX" />`)
5. Paste it in the `<head>` of your `index.html` (just after `<meta charset>`)
6. Redeploy to Netlify
7. Click "Verify" in Search Console
8. Then go to: Sitemaps → Submit: `https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`

**Why:** Google won't reliably find your site without this. The sitemap submission
tells Google exactly what to index and checks back regularly.

### 2. Google Business Profile — SECOND MOST IMPORTANT
> Puts you on Google Maps and "near me" searches in Gulu

1. Go to: https://business.google.com
2. Click "Manage now" → Add your business
3. Business name: **Hope Anchor Tech**
4. Category: **Computer Training School** (primary) + **IT Services** (secondary)
5. Address: Gulu Municipality, Northern Uganda, Uganda
6. Phone: +256 776 815217
7. Website: https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app
8. Hours: Mon–Sat 8am–6pm
9. Verify by phone or postcard
10. Add photos — at minimum: your logo, your training space, and the certificate

**Why:** When someone in Gulu searches "computer training near me" or "IT services Gulu",
your Google Business profile appears in the map pack at the top of results.
This is the fastest way to get local walk-in students.

### 3. Bing Webmaster Tools (free, takes 5 minutes)
> Bing + DuckDuckGo combined are ~15% of searches globally

1. Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. Sign in with Microsoft account
3. Add site: `https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app`
4. Submit sitemap: `https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app/sitemap.xml`

---

### 4. Submit your sitemap directly to Google
Even before Search Console verifies, you can ping Google:

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://hopeanchortech.netlify.app/sitemap.xml
```
Google will respond with "Sitemap notification received."

---

### 5. Create free backlinks (improves your ranking authority)

These are free and take 15–30 minutes each:

| Platform | What to do |
|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | Update your LinkedIn profile → Website field → add your URL |
| **Facebook** | Update Hope Anchor Tech Facebook page → Website field |
| **Crunchbase** | Create a free profile at crunchbase.com → add your org |
| **NGO directories** | List on ngoconnect.net and devex.com (free NGO/social enterprise listings) |
| **Uganda Yellow Pages** | List at ugandayellowpages.com |
| **AfricanBiz** | List at africanbiz.info |

Each of these creates a backlink. Google's ranking algorithm treats
backlinks as "votes of confidence" — the more you have from legitimate
sites, the higher you rank.

---

### 6. Update your sitemap date whenever you make changes
After every significant website update, change the `<lastmod>` date in
`sitemap.xml` to today's date. This tells Google to re-crawl the page.

---

## How to track your progress

After Search Console is verified, check weekly:
- **Performance** tab → see which search queries bring visitors
- **Coverage** tab → make sure all 5 pages are indexed (green)
- **Core Web Vitals** → page speed scores

Typical timeline:
- **Week 1–2:** Google finds and indexes your site after sitemap submission
- **Week 3–4:** You appear in searches for your brand name "Hope Anchor Tech"
- **Month 2–3:** You start appearing for local searches like "computer training Gulu"
- **Month 4–6:** Broader keyword rankings improve as Google trusts your site more
